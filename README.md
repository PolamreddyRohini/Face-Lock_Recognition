# üîí FaceLock ‚Äì A File Locker System Using Facial Recognition

This project implements **FaceLock**, a biometric-based file locker system that uses facial recognition to unlock or lock sensitive files. It replaces traditional passwords with a more secure, intuitive, and hands-free method of authentication using Python.

## üìå Problem Statement

Traditional passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, phishing, and are often forgotten or reused. This leads to compromised data privacy and a poor user experience. FaceLock solves this by using facial recognition to authenticate access to files, ensuring security with ease of use.

## üß† Abstract

FaceLock leverages:
- **OpenCV** for webcam and image handling
- **DeepFace** (with RetinaFace backend) for face recognition
- **Python Cryptography (Fernet)** for file encryption/decryption

The system captures a real-time photo from the webcam, compares it with a reference image, and grants access only on a successful match.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modules Overview

1. **Webcam Capture Module** ‚Äì Takes a real-time snapshot using the webcam.
2. **Face Detection & Recognition** ‚Äì Uses DeepFace with RetinaFace for identity verification.
3. **Authentication Decision** ‚Äì Grants or denies access based on face match.
4. **File Encryption/Decryption** ‚Äì Encrypts/Decrypts files using Fernet (symmetric encryption).
5. **Security Measures** ‚Äì Cleans up temporary images, provides terminal notifications.

## üîê Proposed Algorithm

1. Start the application and webcam.
2. Capture a real-time photo.
3. Compare it with the reference image.
4. If match:
   - If file is encrypted ‚Üí decrypt.
   - If file is decrypted ‚Üí encrypt.
5. If no match ‚Üí deny access.
6. Notify user.
7. Delete temp images.

## üì∏ Output

- Real-time face scanning via webcam.
- Locks or unlocks files securely based on face verification.
- Provides terminal-based notifications.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Multi-user face authentication
- Mobile app version
- Liveness detection to avoid spoofing
- GUI-based interface
- Cloud-based secure file access
- Logging and email/SMS alerts on failed attempts

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**FaceLock** is a robust AI-powered biometric file security system using facial recognition. It removes the need for passwords, adds convenience, and enhances security using deep learning and encryption. Perfect for securing personal or enterprise-level data in real-time.
